    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity refers to the efficiency of an algorithm. It measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, based on the input size. An efficient algorithm has a lower time complexity, which means it can complete its task quickly, even for large inputs.</p>
    <p>Space Complexity is a measure of the memory space an algorithm uses during its execution. It is often denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> is essential to consider because using too much memory can lead to performance issues or even failure when dealing with large data sets.</p>
